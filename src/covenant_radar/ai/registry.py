"""The model registry: registration state, the guard the single call site
consults, and the model-card build check (`plan.md §5.9`'s
`model_registration`, `T-107`).

Persistence-neutral by design — the same shape `security/maker_checker.py`
already uses for the shared approval workflow: the rules in this module
never import SQLAlchemy. `services/model_governance.py` supplies the
database-backed repository, wires the maker-checker approval workflow on
top of it, and is the only writer this module trusts.

`ModelRegistryGuard` is the enforcement half: `ai/client.py`'s single call
site consults it, through an injected instance, before a masked prompt
ever reaches a provider. Two states are refused: no registration at all,
and a registration that has not (or no longer) been approved. Both are
hard failures in production and loud, logged warnings in development, so
the constraint is real without blocking local work that has not registered
its component yet.
