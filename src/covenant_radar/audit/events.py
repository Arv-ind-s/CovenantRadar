"""Canonical audit event-type enumeration and the exemption registry it
protects (contract `C-60`, `T-067`).

Every audit event a service emits declares its event type as one of the
members below.  The coverage test in `tests/security/test_audit_coverage.py`
asserts every literal event-type string used at a `self.audit.record(...)`
call site across `services/*` is a member of this enumeration, so a new
event type is a deliberate addition to this file rather than a typo that
only a later reconciliation of the audit trail would notice.

The exemption registry is the other half of the same guarantee: a
state-changing service method, or one that reads personal-class data under
a privileged permission, is required to record an audit event unless its
``(class name, method name)`` pair is listed here with a non-empty reason.
``validate_exemptions`` enforces the "no reason, no exemption" rule at
import time, and is reused directly by the coverage test.
