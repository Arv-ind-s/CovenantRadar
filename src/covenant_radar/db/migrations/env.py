"""Alembic's migration environment.

Resolves the database URL from `config.set_main_option("sqlalchemy.url",
...)` when a caller has set one (`radarctl migrate --database-url`, or
`tests/migration` pointing at a throwaway database) and otherwise from the
application's own settings (`config/settings.py`) — the same configuration
precedence every other entry point uses, so this file is never a second,
competing source of truth for where the database lives.

Importing `covenant_radar.db.models` registers every table on
`Base.metadata` (see that package's own docstring) before either migration
path below runs, which is what both online migration and `alembic check`'s
autogenerate comparison need to see the complete schema.
