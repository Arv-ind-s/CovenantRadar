"""Seed the model register and evaluation scoreboard for the demo walkthrough.

The governance screen reads `model_registration` and `evaluation_run`
directly and, by design, invents nothing when they are empty.  Nothing in the
seed path wrote either table, so both panels rendered "No model registrations
are recorded" / "No evaluation run has been recorded" — leaving the
documented walkthrough beat (deterministic champion beside the ML challenger,
the challenger's false-escalation result shown as failed and therefore not
promotable) with nothing to show.

Registrations are created through `ModelGovernanceService`, so the maker
event, the maker-checker request and the audit trail are the real ones.  The
evaluation rows contain illustrative scenario scores, not measured harness
results. Both the stored provenance and the screen disclose that distinction.
