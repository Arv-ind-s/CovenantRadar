"""Transparent covenant-breach probability mapping (contract ``C-36``).

The probability in this module is a calibrated *risk score*, not a claim of
statistical certainty.  It is intentionally deterministic and inspectable so
the forecast trace can show exactly how it was formed.

``distance`` is the remaining, non-negative distance to the covenant
boundary.  A smaller positive distance means greater proximity to breach and
therefore a larger distance signal.  ``velocity`` is the signed rate of
change; a negative value is improving and contributes no deterioration
signal.  ``pressure`` is the non-negative magnitude of sustained evidence
pressure.  Each signal is saturated into ``[0, 1]`` before the configured
weights are applied:

* distance proximity: ``1 / (1 + distance)``;
* velocity and pressure: ``x / (1 + x)`` for their non-negative parts;
* velocity and pressure contributions are multiplied by
  ``horizon_days / (horizon_days + 1)``.

The distance term represents the current state, while velocity and pressure
represent forward-looking deterioration.  The weighted sum is clamped to the
configured maximum, whose default is the contract maximum of ``0.99``.  The
zero-signal tuple ``(0, 0, 0)`` is a deliberate neutral sentinel and returns
zero.  Otherwise, a zero or negative distance denotes an immediate boundary
condition and is fixed at the configured maximum.  An explicit
``already_breached`` flag has the same override and is recorded in the
result.

Weights are supplied by the configuration boundary through :meth:`Weights`
or :meth:`Weights.from_mapping`; this module has no policy weight defaults.
Relative non-negative weights are normalized once at construction, and the
normalized values are the ones retained in every result and trace term.
