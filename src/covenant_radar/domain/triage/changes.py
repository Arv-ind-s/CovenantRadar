"""Deterministic comparison of consecutive portfolio triage runs.

The queue is a snapshot, not a live calculation.  This module compares two
such snapshots without depending on persistence or presentation code.  It
deliberately returns a record for the union of both runs: a borrower that is
missing from the newer run is still a visible ``newly_unmonitored`` change.

Only the configured thresholds decide whether a probability movement is
reported and whether a driver is dominant.  No default policy is introduced
when the caller has not supplied those values.
