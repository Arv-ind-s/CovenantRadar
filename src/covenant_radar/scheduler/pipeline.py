"""Nightly pipeline composition: ingest, test, score, rank, update cases and
dispatch, wired as separate `T-120` jobs that share one pipeline run id
(`plan.md §5.9`, `spec §R-28.a`/`R-28.c`).

**Why six jobs, not eight.** `spec §R-28.a`'s prose names eight conceptual
stages — ingest, test, score, forecast, attribute, rank, update cases,
dispatch. `ForecastScoringService` (`T-059`) already computes the forecast
projection and persists driver attribution atomically and resumably, per
covenant, inside one call: splitting "score", "forecast" and "attribute" into
separate retryable jobs would either recompute the same work three times or
register a job with no independent effect of its own — either way a fabricated
step, not a real one. This module therefore composes six real, independently
retryable units: `nightly.ingest`, `nightly.test`, `nightly.score` (which
covers scoring, forecasting and attribution together), `nightly.rank`,
`nightly.update_cases` and `nightly.dispatch`.

**Composition, not business logic.** This module knows the step order and how
to drive `scheduler.runner.JobRunner` through it; it does not know how any
step does its work. `services.nightly.NightlyPipelineService` owns that, and
supplies the `JobHandler` this module registers under each step's name — the
same split `scheduler.jobs`/`scheduler.runner` (policy/execution) already draw
against `services.*` (business logic).

**Idempotency by run id.** Every step handler is idempotent for a given
pipeline run id: rerunning `nightly.test` for the same run either resumes
committed work or is a no-op if that step already finished. This module's own
job is only to *pass the same run id to every step of one pipeline run* and to
halt the sequence at the first step that does not succeed, leaving every later
step — including `nightly.dispatch` — untouched, so the prior day's data keeps
serving the queue (`spec §R-28.a`'s "the run halted at that step ... the prior
day's results still serving the queue").
