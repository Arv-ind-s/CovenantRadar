"""Collect one borrower's persisted facts into stage-7 ``MemoRecords`` (`C-08`).

This module is the missing half of the memo path.  ``MemoAssemblyService``
turns ``MemoRecords`` into the fixed slot map, and ``MemoGenerationService``
drafts and persists from there, but nothing until now read the database to
produce those records — every existing caller built them by hand in a test or
from an evaluation example file.

The rule this module inherits from ``services/memo.py`` is the important one:
**nothing here is calculated.**  Every value is copied from a persisted row,
and every record carries the reference of the row it came from, so the slot
map's provenance stays true all the way back to the database.  Where a fact
was never persisted the record is simply omitted, and memo assembly renders an
explicit absent slot — an absent fact must never arrive as a zero, a guess or
a collection length.

Which row supplies which slot:

===================== ============================================
slot group            source
===================== ============================================
``situation``         ``TriageEntry.what_changed`` for the latest
                      complete run — the persisted statement of
                      what moved this borrower into view.
``covenant_position`` the worst ``Forecast`` (probability,
                      confidence, crossing date, suppression) with
                      the latest ``CovenantTest`` for the same
                      covenant version (value, threshold, headroom)
                      and the ``Covenant`` name.
``drivers``           ``ForecastDriver`` rows for that forecast.
``evidence``          ``EvidenceItem`` rows for the borrower that
                      carry a persisted ``event_count_window``.
``simulations``       ``Simulation`` rows against that forecast,
                      narrowed to ``simulation_ids`` when the
                      caller names them (`C-08`).  Of the packages
                      recorded from the remediation planner, only
                      the latest is cited.
``recommendations``   the steps of that recorded package, each
                      citing its catalogue entry with the sized
                      wording persisted on the step; otherwise the
                      active ``Intervention`` rows applicable to
                      the covenant's class, less the entries only
                      the planner can size.
===================== ============================================

"Worst" follows the same definition the case-file screen uses: the triage
entry's ``worst_covenant_version_id`` at its ``worst_horizon``.  A memo and
the screen that offered it therefore describe the same covenant.
