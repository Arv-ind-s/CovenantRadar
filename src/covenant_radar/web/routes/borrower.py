"""Scoped borrower case-file screen (T-075, contract C-02) and its memo action
(contract C-08).

The case-file route is intentionally read-only.  The view model owns the
case-file read shape and receives a scope before it can load any borrower or
child record.  It does not expose a fallback borrower or an unscoped lookup,
so an unknown borrower and an out-of-scope borrower have the same 404
behaviour.

``POST /memos`` is the one action this module adds.  It never constructs the
model client or the generation service itself — the composition root injects
a ``MemoGenerator``, exactly as it injects the stage-1 proposal generator into
the intake router — so the single model call site stays where it belongs and
this screen stays renderable when no provider is configured at all.
