"""Browser route for the why-panel drawer over every decision stage (`T-071`).

`C-10` names one route — `GET /why/{subject_type}/{subject_id}` — serving
every kind of subject the why-panel can explain. This module resolves and
authorises the subject (`services/explain.py` is deliberately unscoped and
leaves that to its caller), then hands the ordered, named stage records
`T-070` already built to the drawer template. No stage name, threshold
column or field set is decided here or in the template: everything shown is
driven by `audit.trace_reader.ExplainStage`, so a future statistical stage
needs no template change.
