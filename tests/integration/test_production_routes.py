"""The composed production app must actually mount every router that exists.

Every feature router in this codebase is well covered by a test that builds a
minimal app around that one router.  None of those tests can see whether
`create_production_app` ever includes it, and for six browser routers plus the
entire `/api/v1` surface the answer was no: the routers were written, tested
and simply never wired, so `/cases` and `/certificates` returned 404 while
being linked from the navigation, and the documented REST API did not exist at
runtime.

These tests close that gap by asserting against the real composition root.
